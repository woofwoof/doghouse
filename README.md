# General Code.
# INTRO.
# 
# To be quite honest I am uncertain which code will go here. This is a skeleton for the addition of various bits & pieces.
# There exists code to analyse scenes built on Raspbian Wheezy (if I remember right) then announce how many objects are in the scene.
# This announcement is, so far, by means of canned speech and a RF link to a remote handheld unit (currently using LED indicators).
# The idea was that the Raspberry Pi is hovering overhead on a 'drone'.
# Further code (still under development) implements a menu system based upon PiTFTMenu. Other capabilities are being added too...
# The overall intention was that the 'drone' could identify (whatever) objects as it hovered overhead (potentially engaging with them).
# Applications include 'mine', etc. detection, search & rescue and **maybe** pentesting.
# Apologies for the lack of precision right now - I will work on this as & when. Danke.
# END.
