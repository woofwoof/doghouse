# General Code.
# INTRO.
# 
# To be quite honest I am uncertain which code will go here. This is a skeleton for the addition of various bits & pieces.
# There exists code to analyse scenes built on Raspbian Wheezy (if I remember right) then announce how many objects are in the scene.
# This announcement is, so far, by means of canned speech and a RF link to a remote handheld unit (currently using LED indicators).
# The idea was that the Raspberry Pi is hovering overhead on a 'drone'.
# Further code (still under development) implements a menu system based upon PiTFTMenu. Other capabilities are being added too...
# The overall intention was that the 'drone' could identify (whatever) objects as it hovered overhead (potentially engaging with them).
# Applications include 'mine', etc. detection, search & rescue and **maybe** pentesting.
# Apologies for the lack of precision right now - I will work on this as & when. Danke.
# END.
# UPDATE 040919
# Apologies for the lack of activity here. Other matters took over to some extent.
# There now exists basic control level code for a robot (of sorts) though its 'brains' remain work-in-progress.
# I believe the control code is covered in other projects (ROS, etc?) but the 'brains' could be more interesting.
# These 'brains' are of my own design though I am being encourage by SOAR.
# SWI-Prolog is currently being explored for 'brains' (being an 'old hand' at this) with Python remaining at the lower levels.
# As soon as there's something **worthy** of sitting alongside others' work here it will be presented.
# In the meantime thanks for your understanding...
